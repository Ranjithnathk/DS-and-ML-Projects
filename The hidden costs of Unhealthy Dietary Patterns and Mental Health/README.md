## Title : The hidden costs of Unhealthy Dietary Patterns and Mental Health

### <ins>Scientific Conclusion</ins>

#### Objective:
Investigated the relationship between sugar intake (Sugar_2021) and anxiety disorders prevalence (AnxietyDisorders_2021) using Bayesian regression.

#### Key Findings:
Positive association observed with a small effect size (β1\beta_1β1: 0.005, 94% HDI: [0.0037, 0.0063]). Increased sugar intake is linked to higher anxiety prevalence.

#### Implications:
Supports existing research suggesting dietary sugar influences mental health. Findings are credible despite the small magnitude of the effect.

#### Limitations:
Did not account for other factors like physical activity, socioeconomic status, or genetics. Assumes linearity and is limited by the available predictors.

#### Recommendations:
Encourage public health strategies to reduce sugar consumption. Future studies should incorporate additional variables and test for interactions.
